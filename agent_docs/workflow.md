# Workflow
Always check off the box in the implementation plan after a task is completed.

## Setup/Planning
- Go over all the docs and codebase and understand it
- Create the following docs
### Overall Implementation Plan
- Put it in /planning
- An indepth overall implmentation plan making use of checkboxes
- Add a list of possible subagents that could help with implementing the plan.
  
## Feature Implemntation
- Check the corresponding feature doc and understand it
- Create an indepth implmentation plan making use of checkboxes and put it in /planning/features
- Determine and write tests that will be needed for the feature
- The feature has to pass both technical test and visual tests.
- As steps of the feature implementation are completed, check them off in the plan
- Once the feature implementation passes all tests, check it off in the overall implementation plan.

  
## Feature Adding
- Add it to the corresponding doc in /features
- Add it to the overall implementation plan.
- Continue with the feature implementation workflow.
